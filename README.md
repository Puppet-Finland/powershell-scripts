# powershell-scripts

This repository contains various Powershell scripts:

* [Set-Fqdn.ps1](Set-Fqdn.ps1): set computer name and DNS domain to ensure the Puppet's $::fqdn fact is reasonable
* [bootstrap_windows.ps1](bootstrap_windows.ps1): install Puppet Agent on a Windows node

Each script has its own help with the usage details.
